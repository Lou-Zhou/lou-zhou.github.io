Hello! My name is Lou, and I am a Junior at Rice University, studying Statistics and Sport Analytics. I'm originally from Memphis, TN, where I graduated from Memphis University School in 2023. I currently work as a research assistant in [Professor Scott Powers' Lab at Rice University](https://saberpowers.github.io/lab/) where I focus on projects in sport analytics. Additionally, I co-lead a 13-person engineering team which builds internal analytics tools for Rice Athletics. Next Fall, I will also be joining the Oklahoma City Thunder as a basketball analyst intern.

In addition to traditional sports, I also am interested in applications of data science to esports, where I am currently building [gg-pyparser](https://github.com/Lou-Zhou/gg-pyscraper), a Python package which parses Liquipedia esports data for easy use.

Outside of data science, I enjoy gardening, playing soccer, and technical theater.
