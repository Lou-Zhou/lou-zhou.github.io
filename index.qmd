Hello! My name is Lou, and I am a Junior at Rice University, studying Statistics, Sport Analytics, and Mathematics. I'm originally from Memphis, TN, where I graduated from Memphis University School in 2023. At Rice, I am fortunate enough to work as a research assistant in [Professor Scott Powers' Lab at Rice University](https://saberpowers.github.io/lab/) where I focus on projects in sport analytics. Additionally, I help lead a 13-person engineering team which helps build internal scouting and data tools for Rice Athletics. 

In addition to traditional sports, I also am interested in applications of data science to esports, where I have built [gg-pyparser](https://github.com/Lou-Zhou/gg-pyscraper), a Python package which parses Liquipedia esports data for easy use, and am currently working on a Counter-Strike 2 project for my major Capstone.

Outside of data science, I enjoy gardening, playing soccer, and technical theater.
