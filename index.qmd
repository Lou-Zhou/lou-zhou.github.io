Hello! My name is Lou, and I am a Junior at Rice University, studying Statistics and Sport Analytics. I currently serve as a research assistant in [Professor Scott Powers' Lab at Rice University](https://saberpowers.github.io/lab/). Although my background throughout college is primarily in academia, I am interested in solving problems with applied statistics and data science in both industry and academia, with my main focus being in sports.

Outside of data science, I enjoy gardening, playing soccer, and technical theater.
