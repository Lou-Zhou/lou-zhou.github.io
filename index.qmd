Hello! My name is Lou, and I am a Junior at Rice University, studying Statistics and Sport Analytics. I currently work as a research assistant in [Professor Scott Powers' Lab at Rice University](https://saberpowers.github.io/lab/) where I focus on projects in sport analytics. While my experience so far has been primarily in academia, I have always been interested in applying data science and applied statistics to solve real-world problems both in research and industry.

Outside of data science, I enjoy gardening, playing soccer, and technical theater.
