I currently serve as a research assistant in Professor Scott Powers’ Lab at Rice University. Although my background throughout college is primarily in academia, I am interested in solving problems with applied statistics and data science in both industry and academia, with my main focus being in sports.\nOutside of data science, I enjoy gardening, playing soccer, and technical theater.\n\n\nRice University | Houston, TX\nB.A in Statistics and Sport Analytics | August 2023 - May 2027\n\n\n\nRice Athletics | Houston, TX | Student Technical Lead\nIncoming August 2025\nCarnegie Mellon University | Pittsburgh, PA | Undergraduate Researcher\nJune 2025 - July 2025 | Mentors: Karim Kassam, Quang Nguyen\nRice University | Houston, TX | Research Assistant\nAugust 2024 - Present | PI: Scott Powers\nSt. Jude Children’s Research Hospital | Memphis, TN | Research Assistant\nJune 2024 - July 2024 | PI: Gang Wu\nShelby County Election Commission | Memphis, TN | Data Analyst Intern\nJune 2023 - July 2023"

    "text": "Team Coin Flip: Travel Fatigue and Performance\nThis group project looked to determine whether an MLB team’s travel schedule and fatigue had any effect on a team’s in game performance. Initially through our exploratory data analysis, we found that there was significant evidence for the prevelance of home-field advantage, and, through a Granger Causality Test, we found that there was no evidence to support causality between the distance travelled by a team, and their offensive and defensive on-base percentage(OBA).\nWe looked to get a baseline understanding of a team’s ability by developing an ELO ranking system derived from 538’s NFL ELO system, accounting for margin of victory and pitching form. Additionally, two scalars which controlled the extent of ELO change were found by a grid-search parameter tuning method.\nUsing the ELO and a group of fatigue metrics(distance travelled, jet lag, days away team has been on the road, and the difference in travel direction for both teams), we built an XGBoost model which looked to predict the probability of the home team winning for each game. Through a feature analysis, we found that the fatigue metrics had very little effect on the model’s predictions, concluding that fatigue and travel had very little effect on a team’s in game performance.\nThis project was a submission for the 36-hour 2024 Rice Datathon, where we finished 2nd place overall out of 59 teams and received a $700 team prize.\n\n\nBreaking the Cycle: Reducing Recidivism in Iowa State Prisons\n\nThis group project evaluates the factors contributing to prison recidivism and looks to predict the total fiscal cost of recidivism for the May 2023 population of the Iowa state prison system. We created a binary classifier using a Feedforward Neural Network which would predict the probability that an inmate, given certain variables, would re-offend.\nSince it was found that time-sensitive, county-level data (e.g. unemployment rate) affected recidivism rates, we fit distributions to model the length of an inmate’s sentence, given the severity of the crime, and created regressions to model the county-level data at release time. We also used previous data to find the odds of an inmate committing a different severity of crime, given that they re-offend.\nThese models were used in a Monte Carlo simulation, where for each trial, the simulation predicts the release month of each inmate and the county-level parameters at that time. Using these variables, a Feedforward Neural Network predicts the odds of recidivism. We also find what level of crime would be committed, given re-offense, for each crime. We would then find the expected cost of recidivism by multiplying all the odds of recidivism by the fiscal cost of the predicted severity of crime.\nFor factor analysis, we used the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlantations) library which used Shapley values from game theory to find which variables had the most effect on an inmate’s probability of re-offense.\nThis project was created as a submission for the 2023 Modeling the Future Challenge (MTFC), where we finished 2nd place out of 227 teams, gaining a $15,000 team award as well as a publication in the 2023 edition of the Actuarial Clearing House publication."
